# TODO

- [x] ensure kado.o is routable before trying to do NFS
- [ ] allow wireless to fail during boot
- [ ] apply smbios-thermal-blah quiet mode on boot


# multiheaded wayland

idea: 
- root wayland compositor running some number of login "displays" each
- display has a vnc server running waiting for a user to log in?
